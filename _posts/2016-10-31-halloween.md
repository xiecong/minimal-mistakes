We have a lots of boxes since my girl friend bought a lot of stuff from Amazon. Why not use it for our costumes this halloween?


### Here is what you need:
1. Paper boxes
2. Acrylic paint & brushes
3. Glue, tape, and knife

You can get all of these from walmart.

### Step 1: choose your boxes.
Select the right boxes for your head and body.
Use a small one as your head, and a big one as your body.

### Step 2: making your head and body
Carve the boxes. If your small box is not cubic, try to make it into a cube using knife and tape.
For the body, we unfold the large box and carve it for your neck and arms.

### Step 3: color your costume
If you cannot cover the color of the box using your paint, cover it with white paper first.

For pixel-style, try to paint a box with one solid color first. Then paint tiles with random similar color on it. 

### Step 4: making tools
For the tools such as sword and axe, you can draw the shape first, then cut it.

### Step 5: wait until your paint dry
You can use hair dryer or paper towel to make your paint dry faster.

### Step 6: glue them and try on
Wear the box and then glue it. If your box is much larger for your body, you can also glue it first then wear it.

If you don't have time to make arms, remember to wear a green cloth for zombie and blue one for steve.

### Step 7: let's party!
