We have lots of boxes since my girlfriend bought much stuff from Amazon. Why not use it for our costumes this Halloween?


### Here is what you need:
1. Paper boxes
2. Acrylic paint & brushes
3. Glue, tape, and knife

You can get all of these from Wal-Mart.

### Step 1: choose your boxes.
Select the right boxes for your head and body.
Use a small one as your head, and a big one as your body.

### Step 2: making your head and body
If your small box for the head is not cubic, try to make it into a cube using knife and tape.
For the body, we unfold the large box and carve it for your neck and arms.

### Step 3: color your costume
You may want to cover you boxes with white paper first, since some boxes are made from oil paper.

I made Steve for myself and zombie for my girlfriend  :P

Do not forget to carve your eyes after drawing them.

For pixel-style, try to paint a box with one solid color first. Then paint tiles with random similar color on it. 

### Step 4: making tools
For tools such as sword and axe, you can draw the shape first. I made several copies and glue them together to make it thick.

### Step 5: glue them and try on
Wait until your paint is dry. You can use hair dryer or paper towel to make your paint dry faster.

Wear the box and then glue it. If your box is much larger for your body, you can also glue it first then wear it.

If you don't have time to make arms, remember to wear a green cloth for zombie and blue one for Steve.

### Step 6: let's party!
Happy Halloween! We found kids in the party love it very much.
