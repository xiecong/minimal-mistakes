# Simple-Implementation-of-ML-Algorithms
I implementated most common ML algorithms from scratch.
- For an easy understanding, most of the codes implements only minimal versin of the algorithm.
- The implementation uses only numpy.
- Most algorithms are within 100 lines of codes.

Also see decision boundary visualization for implemented classifiers in decision_boundary_vis.py
