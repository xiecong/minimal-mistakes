You can get all of these from walmart.

### Step 1: choose your boxes.
Select the right boxes for your head and body. 

### Step 2: making your head and body
Carve the boxes.

### Step 3: color your costume
You can use white paper to cover the box if your box have color itself.

### Step 4: making tools
For the tools such as sword and axe, you can draw the shape first, then cut it.


### Step 5: wait until your paint dry
You can use hair dryer or paper towel to make your paint dry faster.

### Step 6: glue them and try on
If you don't have time to make arms, remember to wear a green cloth for zombie and blue one for steve.
