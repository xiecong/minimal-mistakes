We have a lots of boxes since my girl friend bought a lot of stuff from Amazon. Why not use it for our costumes this holloween?

### Here is what you need:
1. Paper boxes
  * Use a small one as head, and a big one as body
2. Acrylic paint & brushes
3. Glue, tape, and knife

### Step 1: choose your boxes.
Select the right boxes for your head and body. 

### Step 2: making your head and body
Carve the boxes.

### Step 3: making tools
For the tools such as sword and axe, you can draw the shape first, then cut it.

### Step 4: color your costume

### Step 5: wait until your paint dry

### Step 6: glue them and try on

### Step 7: let's party!
