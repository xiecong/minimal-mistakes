### E-commerce Data Visualization

<li><p>DataV.js<\p>
DataV.js is an open source Javascript library based on D3.js and Rafael.js. It allows people with no pro- gramming knowledge to visualize their data freely. It is now applied in some websites such as Alipay.com and Taobao Index. I am one of the core algorithm designers and the programmers.

*Multi-User Interaction Explorer In this project I used modi ed decision tree to explore interesting transactions such as sales promotions and fake transactions. We visualized the detailed information with a novel design inspired by music notes. Feedbacks from the analysts suggested that it was e ective in supporting a variety of analysis tasks.

*Dynamic Logistics Visualization
This is a cooperation project with Taobao.com. I am the algorithm designer and the programmer. In this project I generated a dynamic density map of logistics datasets using Kernel Density Estimation.

### Didactical

* [**Solving Sudokus like a Pro**](http://jponttuset.github.io/solving-sudokus-like-a-pro-1/)<br>
Code to capture a camera feed, locate a Sudoku grid, find and recognize the numbers, solve it in real time, and overlay the results.

* [**Web Scraping**](http://jponttuset.github.io/deep-learning-scraping/)<br>
Demo to answer whether deep learning is indeed in fashion in computer vision. The code scrapes the paper titles of latest vision conferences from the web and computes the percentage of *deep-learning-related* papers.

### Web

* [**Boosting Object Proposals: From Pascal to COCO**](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~biwiproposals/boosting-coco/)<br>
Webpage to showcase the results of our publication. It involved a decent amount of JavaScript, D3.js, PHP, and MySQL.
