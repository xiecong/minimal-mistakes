### E-commerce Data Visualization
<li><br><b>DataV.js</br></b>
DataV.js is an open source Javascript library based on D3.js and Rafael.js. It allows people with no pro- gramming knowledge to visualize their data freely. It is now applied in some websites such as Alipay.com and Taobao Index. I am one of the core algorithm designers and the programmers.

<br>E-commerce Time-series Explorer</br>
In this project I used modified decision tree to explore interesting transactions such as sales promotions and fake transactions. We visualized the detailed information with a novel design inspired by music notes. Feedbacks from the analysts suggested that it was e ective in supporting a variety of analysis tasks.

<br>Dynamic Logistics Visualization</br>
This is a cooperation project with Taobao.com. I am the algorithm designer and the programmer. In this project I generated a dynamic density map of logistics datasets using Kernel Density Estimation.

### Medical Image Visualization
<br>Clinic Treatment Volume (CTV) Computation of Glioma</br>
This is a cooperation project with The First A liated Hospital, Zhejiang University. I am one of the algorithm designers and the programmers. I extended an existing GPU-based parallel Euclidean distance transform method to compute a 3D distance transform for scenes that contain occluders.

<br>Web Oriented Medical Image Visualization System</br>
This is a research project in my lab. I am one of the algorithm designers and the programmers. I used WebGL to render the volume data in a HTML5-based medical visualization system.
