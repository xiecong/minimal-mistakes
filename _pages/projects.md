### Business Intellegence Visualization
*[**DataV.js**](https://github.com/TBEDP/datavjs)
DataV.js is an open source Javascript library based on D3.js and Rafael.js. It allows people with no pro- gramming knowledge to visualize their data freely. It is now applied in some websites such as Alipay.com and Taobao Index. I am one of the core algorithm designers and the programmers.
It is now applied in some websites such as [Alipay](http://www.alipay.com/) and [Taobao Index](http://shu.taobao.com/). 
Source code in GitHub: 
There is also a DataV.js [Extension](http://goo.gl/4nOOlX) in Chrome Web Store. 

<li><b>E-commerce Time-series Explorer</b><br>
In this project I used modified decision tree to explore interesting transactions such as sales promotions and fake transactions. We visualized the detailed information with a novel design inspired by music notes. Feedbacks from the analysts suggested that it was e ective in supporting a variety of analysis tasks.

<li><b>Dynamic Logistics Visualization</b><br>
This is a cooperation project with Taobao.com. I am the algorithm designer and the programmer. In this project I generated a dynamic density map of logistics datasets using Kernel Density Estimation.

### Medical Image Visualization
<li><b>Clinic Treatment Volume (CTV) Computation of Glioma</b><br>
This is a cooperation project with The First A liated Hospital, Zhejiang University. I am one of the algorithm designers and the programmers. I extended an existing GPU-based parallel Euclidean distance transform method to compute a 3D distance transform for scenes that contain occluders.
</li>
<li><b>Web Oriented Medical Image Visualization System</b><br>
This is a research project in my lab. I am one of the algorithm designers and the programmers. I used WebGL to render the volume data in a HTML5-based medical visualization system.
</li>

### Other

<li><b>AVIS</b><br>
AVIS is a numerical 3D meteorological data visualization system. I am one of the programmers. I visualized the wind vector field using Streamline and Line Integral Convolution (LIC) in this project.
