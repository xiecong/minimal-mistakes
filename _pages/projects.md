* **Hypergraph Learning on Heterogeneous Data**<br>
A classification algorithm on heterogeneous data using hypergraph model, which represents higher order relationships than the traditional graph-based models. This algorithm was applied on the public health datasets and census datasets of New York state. I was the main algorithm designer and programmer.

* **Evolutionary Analysis of Deep Neural Networks**<br> 
A neural network analysis system which was able to evaluate the intermediate layers. Two metrics were proposed for diagnosis of the network (e.g., detecting overfitting and underfitting). I was one of the core algorithm designers and the programmers. 

* **Joint Distribution Reconstruction of New York Health Data**<br>
An algorithm to reconstruct the complete patient data from partial information from New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling approach was used to uniformly sample the high-dimensional solution space of reconstruction. I was the main algorithm designer and programmer.

* [**Microsoft PowerBI**](http://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals-core)<br>
A business intelligence tool based on D3.js. 
I developed the Enhanced Scatter Plot Chart and Timeline Chart for the web version of Power BI.

* [**DataV.js**](http://github.com/TBEDP/datavjs)<br>
DataV.js is an open source Javascript library based on D3.js and Rafael.js. It allows people with no programming knowledge to visualize their data freely. It is now applied in some websites such as Alipay.com and Taobao Index. I am one of the core algorithm designers and the programmers.
It is now applied in some websites such as [Alipay](http://www.alipay.com/) and [Taobao Index](http://shu.taobao.com/). 
There is also a DataV.js [Extension](http://goo.gl/4nOOlX) in Chrome Web Store. 

* **Detecting fake transactions in online sales data of Alibaba.com**<br>
A system for detecting fake transactions, which are made by the users who wants to increase their sales rankings. A modified decision tree was employed in our algorithm. I was the main algorithm designer and programmer.

* **Clinic Treatment Volume Computation of Glioma**<br>
A cooperation project with The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University. We used GPU-based parallel Euclidean distance transform method CTV computation of Glioma. I was one of the algorithm designers and the programmers.
