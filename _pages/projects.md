### Business Intellegence Visualization
* [**Microsoft PowerBI**](http://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals-core)
I developed the Enhanced Scatter Plot Chart and Timeline Chart for thr web version of Power BI.

* [**DataV.js**](http://github.com/TBEDP/datavjs)<br>
DataV.js is an open source Javascript library based on D3.js and Rafael.js. It allows people with no pro- gramming knowledge to visualize their data freely. It is now applied in some websites such as Alipay.com and Taobao Index. I am one of the core algorithm designers and the programmers.
It is now applied in some websites such as [Alipay](http://www.alipay.com/) and [Taobao Index](http://shu.taobao.com/). 
There is also a DataV.js [Extension](http://goo.gl/4nOOlX) in Chrome Web Store. 

* **E-commerce Time-series Explorer**<br>
In this project I used modified decision tree to explore interesting transactions such as sales promotions and fake transactions. We visualized the detailed information with a novel design inspired by music notes. Feedbacks from the analysts suggested that it was e ective in supporting a variety of analysis tasks.

* **Dynamic Logistics Visualization**<br>
This is a cooperation project with Taobao.com. I am the algorithm designer and the programmer. In this project I generated a dynamic density map of logistics datasets using Kernel Density Estimation.

### Scientific Visualization
* **Clinic Treatment Volume (CTV) Computation of Glioma** <br>
This is a cooperation project with The First A liated Hospital, Zhejiang University. I am one of the algorithm designers and the programmers. I extended an existing GPU-based parallel Euclidean distance transform method to compute a 3D distance transform for scenes that contain occluders.


* **AVIS** <br>
AVIS is a numerical 3D meteorological data visualization system. I am one of the programmers. I visualized the wind vector field using Streamline and Line Integral Convolution (LIC) in this project.
