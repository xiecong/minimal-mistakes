### Business Intellegence Visualization
* [**Microsoft PowerBI**](http://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals-core)<br>
Power BI is visualization tool based on D3.js.
I developed the Enhanced Scatter Plot Chart and Timeline Chart for the web version of Power BI.

* [**DataV.js**](http://github.com/TBEDP/datavjs)<br>
DataV.js is an open source Javascript library based on D3.js and Rafael.js. It allows people with no programming knowledge to visualize their data freely. It is now applied in some websites such as Alipay.com and Taobao Index. I am one of the core algorithm designers and the programmers.
It is now applied in some websites such as [Alipay](http://www.alipay.com/) and [Taobao Index](http://shu.taobao.com/). 
There is also a DataV.js [Extension](http://goo.gl/4nOOlX) in Chrome Web Store. 

* **E-commerce Time-series Explorer**<br>
In this project I used modified decision tree to explore interesting transactions such as sales promotions and fake transactions. We visualized the detailed information with a novel design inspired by music notes. Feedbacks from the analysts suggested that it was e ective in supporting a variety of analysis tasks.

* **Dynamic Logistics Visualization**<br>
This is a cooperation project with Taobao.com. I am the algorithm designer and the programmer. In this project I generated a dynamic density map of logistics datasets using Kernel Density Estimation.

### Scientific Visualization
* **Clinic Treatment Volume (CTV) Computation of Glioma** <br>
This is a cooperation project with The First A liated Hospital, Zhejiang University. I am one of the algorithm designers and the programmers. I extended an existing GPU-based parallel Euclidean distance transform method to compute a 3D distance transform for scenes that contain occluders.


* **AVIS** <br>
AVIS is a numerical 3D meteorological data visualization system. I am one of the programmers. I visualized the wind vector field using Streamline and Line Integral Convolution (LIC) in this project.
